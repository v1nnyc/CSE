Program description:
Board.java:
this program makes the board for the game 2048. it can make a new board, or it can load one if you’ve already started a game. it’s also responsible adding new tiles to the board after you move. and for some reason it includes a method that rotates the board.
gamemanager.java:
this program basically makes sure that you’re following the rules. when you input a move it checks to see if thats a valid input, and if it is, it assigns it to a move and then moves that way. if the input isn’t valid then you’re reprompted to enter a move.

short responses:
vim:
1. you can jump to a certain line by using G. (to go to line 20 you’d enter 20G.)
2.you can turn on autoindent by entering :set autoindent in the command line. to turn it off you can enter :set noautoindent.
3. the command to undo changes is “u”
4.so there are four ways you can jump forward by word. the first is w, it jumps by the start of words, and considers punctuation as a word. W also jumps by the start of words, however is uses spaces to separate the words. using e will jump to the end of words, and considers punctuation. E jumps to the end of words but doesnt consider punctuation to be a word. to go back you can use either b or B. b considers punctuation to be a word, B doesnt.

unix/linux:
5. to remove all .class files in a unix directory, (ok im assuming that you’re asking this as if we were already in that directory) you can enter “rm *.class”
6. to remove a directory you use “rmdir whateverthedirectoryiscalled”. a directory must be empty before you can use rmdir, though. so if a directory isn’t empty you can use “rm -r whateverthedirectoryiscalled”
7. to clear a unix terminal screen you can enter “clear” and it will clear it. or you can use “reset”. clear just clears the screen whereas reset re-initializes the terminal.
