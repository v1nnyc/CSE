Program description:
ok there are like 4 different classes that make different animals. the bear class makes bear objects, as do the lion tiger and dragon classes. each class determines how the object will act. what direction it will move in, what color it is, whether it will eat or not, how it will attack, and how it will appear on the board. The whole simulation is kind of a fighting game. each animal will fight with the other animals and mate with similar animals. they will also eat food dots on the board. they keep moving unless they sleep, mate, or are eating. any animal that is attacked while it’s sleeping or eating or mating will automatically lose. also when the animals mate they make little lower case letters and it’s cute because they’re babies.

Short Response:
Vim q’s:
1. to turn syntax coloring on and off you can use the commands “syntax on” and “syntax off”
2. to highlight the current line you’re on you can press shift + v, which will put you in visual mode and highlight the current line.

Unix/Linux q’s:
3. so assuming foo is in the current working directory: 
$ cut -c5-13 foo
would cut the columns 5-13

Java q’s:
4.you can create an array of ints with all the odd numbers between 0-10 in one line with:
int[] theArray = {1,3,5,7,9};
